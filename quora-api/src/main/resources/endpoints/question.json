The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.”\nThe bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:\n``` Authorization: Bearer <token>\n```\nSimilarly to Basic authentication, Bearer authentication should only be used over HTTPS (SSL).\nRead https://jwt.io/introduction/ for more information on JWT standard.\n"
